**Play alpha version online here:** https://joefriedlander.github.io/isouisce
(only tested in Chrome)

### Guide:
1. Keep land above water.
2. Make sure numlock is on and use keypad to move around. Press spacebar or center keypad key (5) to place blocks on land to add height.
3. Don't place blocks in the water - they will splash.

### More Info:
Inspired by Wetrix developed by Zed Two (see gameplay video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDdxAl47Hi4&t=12 ), but with different rules: In the original Wetrix, the goal is to place blocks to prevent water from falling off the table. In isoUisce the goal is to place blocks to prevent the ground from sinking.

## TODO:
- Organize todo list better
- get core gameplay down incl. block rotation
- switch to and use typescript 
- prevent squares from blocking view: transparency, camera change, overhead view?
- minimize screen doesn't pause timer fix
- disable repeat keystrokes for spamming blocks down? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17514798/how-to-disable-repetitive-keydown-in-javascript
- fish attack that take away block, others help, bring blocks. 
- splash has chance to affect surrounding squares, square flash and has sink multiplier
- splash can be used to attack enemies who get too close? vs building walls to protect, splash only goes outwards to attack?
- let a stream of water into base to grow plants? put item down to prevent block from sinking etc
- look into insaneaquarium ideas
- shadow over water easy to differentiate
- 8 bit graphics style/better style?
- Atlantis theme, crumbling columns etc fits with sinking ground
- fix framerate https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19764018/controlling-fps-with-requestanimationframe
- song idea - Polovtsian Dances by Alexander Borodin instrumental/8bit like song create. As the original Tetris game had a Russian song
